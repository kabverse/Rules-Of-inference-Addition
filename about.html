            <h2>Rules of Inference</h2>
            <p>
                Rules of inference are logical principles that outline valid methods for deriving conclusions from premises in formal logic. They serve as the foundation for constructing logical arguments and proofs, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are logically consistent with the premises.
            </p>
            <p>
                In essence, these rules dictate how one can move from known truths (premises) to new truths (conclusions) in a systematic way. They are used in various fields, including mathematics, philosophy, and computer science, to formalize reasoning processes and support sound arguments.

            <h3>Commonly Referenced Rules of Inference:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modus Ponens:</strong> From a conditional statement and its antecedent, one can conclude the consequent.</li>
                <li><strong>Modus Tollens:</strong> From a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent, one can conclude the negation of the antecedent.</li>
                <li><strong>Disjunctive Syllogism:</strong> From a disjunction and the negation of one disjunct, one can conclude the other disjunct.</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothetical Syllogism:</strong> From two conditional statements, one can derive a new conditional statement.</li>
                <li><strong>Conjunction:</strong> From two true statements, one can assert their conjunction.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> From a conjunction, one can conclude either of the conjuncts.</li>
            </ul>

                These rules provide a structured way to analyze arguments, ensuring logical consistency and validity in reasoning.
